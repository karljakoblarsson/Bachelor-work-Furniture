We started in January 2016 and will, if everything goes according to plan, be
done i May.

This is our diary while working on our bachelors's thesis at
Chalmers University of Technology.  We are working on three related problems in
creating photrealistic renders of furniture, with a focus on cloth and woven
materials.
