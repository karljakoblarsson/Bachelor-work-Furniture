![Agen chair from IKEA]({{ site.baseurl }}/assets/rattan/agen-fatolj.jpg)

We are trying to generate geometry which is similar to rattan as used in
furniture. Rattan furniture is made up of many hundreds of individual strands
which makes it a challenge to model them by hand. We are trying to develop an
algorithm which takes in simple geometry to describe the surfaces and then
procedurally generate geometry similar to hand-woven rattan.

The goal is to implement our eventual algorithm as a 3ds Max-plugin. But
plugin-development for 3ds Max is quite frustrating so we will start by
implementing it in [Blender](https://www.blender.org). Blender is open source and
scriptable using python which will make it easier to try out different ideas.

Hopefully the end result is something similar to the [Agen chair](http://www.ikea.com/se/sv/catalog/products/50058376/)
from IKEA seen above.
