Right now most of our work is on the final report. In three weeks we need to
hand in the first complete version of our project report. The project report is
the most important and biggest deliverable of our project. We began writing
many weeks ago, some parts were lifted with a little clean-up from our planning
report we handed in in February.

Right now our focus is on completing the method and implementation chapters
and the results chapter as well. The work is progressing but not as fast as we
would like.

We have wondered and discussed a lot about the division between *method* and
*implementation* parts of the report. None of the resources we have looked at
have given us a complete answer. Our supervisor Marco said that it is very
different between institutions and even individual supervisors.

But he gave the best explanation I have heard. Or the one that gave me the most
insight. The method chapter is about design-choices and the implementation
chapter is about implementation choices. Or choices determined not by what is
the best path forward but by what is most feasible to implement at that stage
in the project. Where design choices is more about what is the optimal
path if we could choose freely.

This help me at least and now the writing is easier for me.
